# Week 07
## Write the python code to build the following learning model:
+ Naive Bayes [➡️](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2007/NaiveBayes.ipynb)
+ SVM [➡️](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2007/SVM.ipynb)

Build the models for **_at least 4 datasets_**, with *at least 4 train_test_split combinations*.
Perform the data pre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.
