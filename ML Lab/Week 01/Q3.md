The length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display “28 or 29 days” for February so that leap years are addressed.
```
# Get the name of the month from the user
month = input("Enter the name of a month: ")

# Convert the month name to lowercase
month = month.lower()

# Determine the number of days in the month
if month == "january" or month == "march" or month == "may" or month == "july" or month == "august" or month == "october" or month == "december":
    days = 31
elif month == "april" or month == "june" or month == "september" or month == "november":
    days = 30
elif month == "february":
    days = "28 or 29"
else:
    days = "Error: Invalid month name"

# Display the result
print(month.capitalize(), "has", days, "days.")
```

_Using dictionary_
```
# Dictionary of the number of days in each month
days_in_month = {"january": 31, "february": 28, "march": 31, "april": 30, "may": 31, "june": 30,
                 "july": 31, "august": 31, "september": 30, "october": 31, "november": 30, "december": 31}

# Get the name of the month from the user
month = input("Enter the name of a month: ")

# Convert the month name to lowercase
month = month.lower()

# Look up the number of days in the month in the dictionary
if month in days_in_month:
    if month == "february":
        print(month.capitalize(), "has 28 or 29 days.")
    else:
        print(month.capitalize(), "has", days_in_month[month], "days.")
else:
    print("Error: Invalid month name") 
```
