A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”, “civic”,
“level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words. Write a program that reads a
string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a palindrome. Display
the result, including a meaningful output message.
Note: Write a user-defined function that takes a string as user input from the terminal and
returns the status as “palindrome” or “non-palindrome”.

```
def is_palindrome(word):
    # Reverse the string
    reverse = word[::-1]

    # Compare the reverse to the original
    if word == reverse:
        return "palindrome"
    else:
        return "non-palindrome"

# Get the word from the user
word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Call the function to check if the word is a palindrome
result = is_palindrome(word)

# Print the result
print("The word is a", result + ".")
```
