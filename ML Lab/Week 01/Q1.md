Q1) An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos in an order from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the order.
```
# Get the number of widgets and gizmos from the user
num_widgets = int(input("Enter the number of widgets: "))
num_gizmos = int(input("Enter the number of gizmos: "))

# Compute the weight of each type of product
widget = 75 * num_widgets
gizmo = 112 * num_gizmos

# Compute the total weight of the order
total_weight = widget + gizmo

# Display the result
print("The total weight of the order is", total_weight, "grams.")
```
