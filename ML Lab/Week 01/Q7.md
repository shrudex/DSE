Your function should read a list of numbers from the user and remove the two largest and
two smallest values from it. Display the list with the outliers removed, followed by the original
list. Your program should generate an appropriate error message if the user enters less than 4
values.

```
def remove_outliers(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 4:
        raise ValueError("The list must have at least 4 numbers.")

    numbers.sort()
    trimmed = numbers[2:-2]
    return trimmed

# Get the list of numbers from the user
numbers = []
print("Enter the numbers. Type 'done' to finish.")
while True:
    number = input("Enter a number: ")
    if number == 'done':
        break
    numbers.append(int(number))

try:
    trimmed = remove_outliers(numbers)
    print("The trimmed list is:", trimmed)
    print("The original list is:", numbers)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```
