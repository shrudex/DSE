# Week 09

## [✅](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2009/week09%20-%20ensembleLearning%20%5Bpipeline%5D.ipynb)Q1
### Write the python codes to build the _Ensemble Learning_ models on at least 4 datasets using pipeline. 
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Perform the data pre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.

## [✅](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2009/week09%20-%20dimensionalityReduction.ipynb)Q2
### Write the python codes to perform _Dimesnionality Reduction_ on at least 4 datasets using at least 6 techniques.
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Analyse the performance for the different DR techniques.

## [✅](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2009/week09%20-%20clusteringMethods.ipynb)Q3
### Write the python codes to build the _Clustering_ models on at least 4 datasets (using K-means, K-median, K-means++ & Hierarchical).
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Perform the data pre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.
