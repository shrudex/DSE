# Week 09

## ✅Q1
### Write the python codes to build the _Ensemble Learning_ models on at least 4 datasets using pipeline. 
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Perform the data pre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.

## ✅Q2
### Write the python codes to perform _Dimesnionality Reduction_ on at least 4 datasets using at least 6 techniques.
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Analyse the performance for the different DR techniques.

## ✅Q3
### Write the python codes to build the _Clustering_ models on at least 4 datasets (using K-means, K-median, K-means++ & Hierarchical).
Build the models with at least 4 train_test_split combinations and different set of hyper-parameter values. Perform the data pre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.
