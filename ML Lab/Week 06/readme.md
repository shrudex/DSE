# Week 06

## Write the python code to build the following learning model:
+ KNN using scikit-learn - [here](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2006/KNN-scikit.ipynb)
+ KNN from scratch - [here](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2006/KNN%20-%20Scratch.ipynb)
+ Decision Tree - [here](https://github.com/shrudex/DSE/blob/main/ML%20Lab/Week%2006/DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb)

Build the models for one dataset, with one train_test_split.
Perform the datapre-processing and performance evaluation for the models.
