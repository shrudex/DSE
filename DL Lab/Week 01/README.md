# Exercise 01
Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of predicting Body Fat. Using the Body Fat dataset, write a Neural Network to predict body fat:
- Number of Hidden layers = 3 and number of units are 128,64,32
- Use RELU activation function, let learning rate be 0.1

*Spit the data into (80,20) split and tabulate the performance in terms of RMSE for100 epochs and comment on performance.*

The attributes of the dataset are :
- Density determined from underwater weighing
- Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
- Age (years)
- Weight (lbs)
- Height (inches)
- Neck circumference (cm)
- Chest circumference (cm)
- Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
- Hip circumference (cm)
- Thigh circumference (cm)
- Knee circumference (cm)
- Ankle circumference (cm)
- Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
- Forearm circumference (cm)
- Wrist circumference (cm)
