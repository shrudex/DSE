## Week 04 - Searching & Sorting

- Q1. Write a parallel program using OpenMP to implement the Selection sort algorithm. Compute the efficiency and plot the speed up for varying input size and thread number.
- Q2. Write a parallel program using openMP to implement the following: Take an array of input size m. Divide the array into two parts and sort the first half using insertion sort and second half using quick sort. Use two threads to perform these tasks. Use merge sort to combine the results of these two sorted arrays.
- Q3. Write a parallel program using OpenMP to implement sequential search algorithm. Compute the efficiency and plot the speed up for varying input size and thread number
